# RecipeGPT 🥩🥗🧁
An Android app used for generating recipes by sending queries to OpenAI's GPT-4o model to process them and return recipes 🤤🍰


## Usage

- All you have to do is open the app, search the type of food you want to cook like "chocolate cake" or "caeser salad"
- The app will display some results and you can click on the *details* button to open up a new page where you'll find the exact ingredients necessary and the steps for preparing the food
- You will also see that the quantities are mentioned next to them, if the number is in red that means that you do not have enough of that specific ingredient, while green means that you have enough.
- You will also be able to save the recipe on your phone so you can come back to it later or delete it if you so desire
- You can also click on the *cooked* button which basically removes from your "inventory" the ingredients required by that recipe
- You can also view the list of ingredients you need to buy, in order to be able to prepare all the recipes you have saved on your phone
- Here you have 2 settings, one which sets the frequency at which you receive random cooking quotes from the internet, the other one sets the number of recipes you want to generate on each search.
