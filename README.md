# RecipeGPT üìúü•óüßÅ
An Android app used for generating recipes by sending queries to OpenAI's GPT-4o model to process them and return recipes ü§§üç∞
It also shares with you cooking wisdom through its AI-generated quotes üß†üë©üèª‚Äçüç≥

## Usage

- The app allows you to save recipes on your phone, and also it allows you note what ingredients you have around or you're going to buy. This data is stored in a sort of ***inventory*** on the phone.

- All you have to do is open the app, search the type of food you want to cook like ***chocolate cake*** or ***caeser salad***. The app will display some results and you can click on the ***details*** button to open up a new page where you'll find the exact ingredients necessary and the steps for preparing the food.

- In the recipe details page, you will see that the quantities are mentioned next to them, if the number is in red that means that you do not have enough of that specific ingredient, while green means that you have enough. You will also be able to save the recipe on your phone so you can come back to it later or delete it if you so desire. You can also click on the ***cooked*** button which basically removes from your ***inventory*** the ingredients required by that recipe.

- From the recipe details page, you can also choose to set a recipe as ***listed***. This means that the app will add to the shopping list all the necessary ingredients and the quantities required by the recipe that you still don't have in your virtual ***inventory***.

- You can view the list of ingredients you need to buy, in order to be able to prepare all the recipes you have saved on your phone, and you can select the amount and quantity that you're buying or that you already have lying around.

- You can check your ***inventory*** by navigating to the ***ingredients*** page. There you can choose to edit or delete any of the saved ingredients.

- In preferences you have 2 settings, one which sets the frequency at which you receive random cooking quotes from the internet, the other one sets the number of recipes you want to generate on each request. The waiting time can be pretty big sometimes when generating recipes, so going for large numbers isn't going to work very well, since the server might throw a timeout exception.


## Technical Details

### 1. Web Server 
- Built with ExpressJS, hosted on heroku. It sends prompts to OpenAI's gpt-4o to generate the recipes and it fetches them, then they get redirected to the app requesting them. Check out the repo by clicking [here](https://github.com/mmswflow-upb/recipe-provider-web-server.git).

### 2. App Structure & Components Used
1. Activities - The app implements two activities, one called ***HomeActivity*** and the other ***RecipeDetailsActivity***. The ***HomeActivity*** contains 5 fragments that are reachable through the bottom navigation menu, they're grouped together in one activity because they do not focus on a single specific object. The ***RecipeDetailsActivity*** is started only when the user wants to view the details of a specific recipe.

2. Intents - Starting the ***RecipeDetailsActivity*** when clicking on the ***details*** button of a saved or generated recipe. Also when sharing recipes, an intent set with ***ACTION_SEND*** is used to let other apps know that we're going to share a recipe as plain text through them.

3. Foreground Services - Displaying the persistent notification while waiting for API return generated recipes, it shows the elapsed time since the request has been made.

4. Background Services - Saving or fetching recipes or ingredients from the ROOM database, checking if the requirements for cooking a recipe are met, and removing from the DB the ingredients of a recipe when pressing on the ***cooked*** button.

5. Bound Services - Bound to the ***HomeFragment*** when the view gets created. The ***generateRecipesService*** is used to make requests to the API. 

6. Broadcast Receivers - Whenever there's a change in the database, the ***DatabaseBackgroundService*** notifies all broadcast receivers about it, then the fragments linked to them have to update their UI accordingly. 

7. Shared Preferences - Save small, persistent key-value data such as user settings.

8. Content Providers - Share data between applications or components.

9. Database - Store structured data locally (e.g., using Room or SQLite).

10. Usage of External APIs - Our app fetches recipes and random cooking quotes from our own [custom-made web server](https://github.com/mmswflow-upb/recipe-provider-web-server.git) which is hosted online, we used ***Retrofit*** to implement the ***OkHttpClient***.

11. Notifications - Notify users about important updates or events.
